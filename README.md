CapacitiveSensor was originally written by Paul Badger and is now maintained by Paul Stoffregen.

### Forked for my personal project https://github.com/ozatyx/tattoo-slider to work with a XIAO ESP32-C3
### Library does not work until used with Paul Stoffregen's OneWire library: https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/OneWire
